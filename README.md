# SMBGhost
Advanced scanner for CVE-2020-0796 - SMBv3 RCE using [ollypwn](https://github.com/ollypwn) detection technique ([SMBGhost](https://github.com/ollypwn/SMBGhost)).

It can scan the entire internet using masscan or, a single ip.

It can get more informations about targets using Shodan (API key required) and write results to json file.

Otherwise, it will print vulnerable ip on the console.

## Getting Started

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

```
sudo apt-get install git gcc make libpcap-dev
git clone https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
cd masscan
make
cp bin/masscan /usr/bin/.
```

### Installing
